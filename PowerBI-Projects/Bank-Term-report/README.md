### Education Level:
Majority of clients hold university or high school degrees, suggesting interest from educated individuals.
### Marital Status:
Married clients dominate (61%), followed by singles (28%), which may imply financial planning due to family responsibilities.
### Monthly Engagement:
May is the peak month for campaigns, while other months show lower engagement, indicating a seasonal trend.
### Default Status:
Most clients (32,588) have no default, with a small number having an actual default, indicating financial stability.
### Housing Status:
All records include housing data, useful for segmentation and targeting.

# Suggestions:

### Target Younger, Educated Clients:
Develop tailored campaigns for the 25–40 age group, focusing on financial planning benefits.
### Focus on Married Clients:
Offer family-oriented products, joint deposit options, or loyalty programs to appeal to married clients.
### Boost Engagement in Off-Peak Months:
Introduce special promotions in low-activity months to balance engagement throughout the year.
### Clarify Default Status:
Verify and update the ‘unknown’ default data to improve risk assessment and targeting.
### Use Housing Data for Targeting:
Segment campaigns by housing status, as homeowners may be more likely to invest in long-term products.

This approach could drive conversions, enhance customer relationships, and improve risk management for term deposits.
